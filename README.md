This is a project demonstrating the whole test piramid in a React + Redux application.

The usage of React and Redux has been simplified to maintain the focus on the testing problem.

This application demonstrates aspects of Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and e2e Testing.

It will be used as the base of my talk in a meetup of React developers at my city.
